        New York, often called New York City[a] or NYC, is the most populous city in the United States. With a 2020
        population of 8,804,190 distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2), New York City is the most densely
        populated major city in the United States and more than twice as populous as Los Angeles, the nation's
        second-largest city. New York City is located at the southern tip of New York State. It constitutes the
        geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the
        largest metropolitan area in the U.S. by both population and urban area. With over 20.1 million people in its
        metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, New York is one of
        the world's most populous megacities, and over 58 million people live within 250 mi (400 km) of the city.[10]
        New York City is a global cultural, financial, entertainment, and media center with a significant influence on
        commerce, health care and life sciences,[11] research, technology, education, politics, tourism, dining, art,
        fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for
        international diplomacy,[12][13] and is sometimes described as the capital of the world.[14][15]
