        Tapestry showing Arthur as one of the Nine Worthies, wearing a coat of arms often attributed to him,[1] c. 1385
        King Arthur (Welsh: Brenin Arthur, Cornish: Arthur Gernow, Breton: Roue Arzhur) is a legendary king of Britain,
        and a central figure in the medieval literary tradition known as the Matter of Britain. In Welsh sources, Arthur
        is portrayed as a leader of the post-Roman Britons in battles against Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain in the
        late 5th and early 6th centuries. He first appears in two early medieval historical sources, the Annales
        Cambriae and the Historia Brittonum, but these date to 300 years after he is supposed to have lived, and most
        historians who study the period do not consider him a historical figure.[2][3] His name also occurs in early
        Welsh poetic sources such as Y Gododdin.[4] The character developed through Welsh mythology, appearing either as
        a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore,
        sometimes associated with the Welsh otherworld Annwn.[5]

        The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey
        of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of
        Britain).[6] Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established a vast
        empire. Many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey's
        Historia, including Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, the magician Merlin, Arthur's wife Guinevere, the sword
        Excalibur, Arthur's conception at Tintagel, his final battle against Mordred at Camlann, and final rest in
        Avalon. The 12th-century French writer Chrétien de Troyes, who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story,
        began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature. In these French
        stories, the narrative focus often shifts from King Arthur himself to other characters, such as various Knights
        of the Round Table. The themes, events and characters of the Arthurian legend vary widely from text to text, and
        there is no one canonical version. Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the
        centuries that followed, until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century. In the 21st century, the
        legend continues to have prominence, not only in literature but also in adaptations for theatre, film,
        television, comics and other media.
